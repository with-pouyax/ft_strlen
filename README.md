# ft_strlen

This repository is dedicated to the `ft_strlen` function, a core utility in C programming for determining the length of a string. The function iterates through each character of the string until it encounters the null terminator, `'\0'`, counting the number of characters along the way.

## Description

`ft_strlen` is an essential function that returns the length of a given string. It does not count the null terminator as part of the string's length, providing an accurate measurement of the string's size in characters. This function is widely used in various programming tasks, such as memory allocation, string manipulation, and validation processes.
